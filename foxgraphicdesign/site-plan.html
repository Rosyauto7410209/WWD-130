      <h3>Set up an appointment</h3>
      <p>
        The purpose of this page is about getting in contact with me to learn more about custom designs and discuss other services that clients would want. Setting up appointments can affect a client's trust in your business as well as help gain good reviews that could attract more clients in the future. Maintaining good communication also helps me understand what my clients are looking for in a design as well as preventing situations that could occur from not asking questions. Miscommunication can cause many problems in this industry such as changes that were not wanted, so I aim to prevent it by contacting my future clients frequently and sharing my progress with any designs they commissioned as well.
