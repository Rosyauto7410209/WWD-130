    <P>info about me</P>

    <p>My name is Sean, I'm 23 and I currently live in Panguitch, Utah. There isn't a whole lot out here, but it is a nice place to live. I am the second oldest of four siblings and I just recently got off my mission.</p>
     <p>I am working towards a bachelors degree in software programming so I can pursue a career in programming.</p>
        <P>Some hobbies I enjoy include reading and gunsmithing. I used to work in the pest control business and in the food industry. I hope to learn much from this course and hope to get to know you all. </p>
